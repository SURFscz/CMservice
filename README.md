# CMservice
A webservice for collecting and storing end-user consent of attributes.

# Install dependencies
To install all necessary dependencies, run `python setup.py install` in the root directory.

# Run CMservice 

Copy the **settings.cfg.example** and rename the copy **settings.cfg**. If needed modify the 
necessary configurations. 

```shell
CMSERVICE_CONFIG=<path to settings.cfg> gunicorn cmservice.service.run:app
```

Make sure to setup HTTPS cert and key, and bind to the correct host/port using
[gunicorn settings](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/settings.html).

# Storage
Some information has to be stored in order for the CMservice to work

## Database alternatives
Currently the consent could be stored in either in memory database or in a 
SQLite database. Please read the "Configuration" section 
for more information on how to switch between the different database instances.

## Stored infomation


### Consent database
| Database column | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| consent_id | An unique id for a consent, generated by the client. Before the consent ID is strored in the database a SALT is concatinated with the consent id recived from the client and it is then hashed |
| timestamp | Time for when the consent where given. |
| month | For how many months the consent where given. After that particular date the user needs to give consent again. |
| attributes | All the attributes for which consent where given. Note that it's only for which attributes consent where given and not the values. |
| question_hash | The consent question sent by the client. It's a hash over who sent the original request, the consent_id, the selected attributes and values |

### Ticket database

| --------------- | ----------- |
| Ticket | A identifier for the ticket |
| Timestamp | The time then the ticket where created |
| TicketData | The unpacked original consent request which where sent as a singed JWT. The request contains user attributes and values in plain text, a user ID a redirect URL, information about the service provider making the request |


# Development

## i18n

To extract all i18n string:

```bash
python setup.py extract_messages --input-paths src/cmservice/ --output-file src/cmservice/service/data/i18n/messages.pot
```

To compile .po->.mo:

```bash
python setup.py compile_catalog --directory src/cmservice/service/data/i18n/locales/
```
